Killing yourself to become irreplaceable at work makes you a prisoner. You’re slowly trapping yourself in specialized knowledge that’s only useful where you are, and while that may give you a sense of security, it takes away your freedom.

Value isn’t about being irreplaceable at work; it’s about being capable of sharing what you know and then walking away to do something else. Your skills and knowledge should open doors, not close them.

Let someone else be irreplaceable while you focus on being free.
