If you’re going to judge someone’s work, you owe them clarity. Set expectations upfront and be consistent.

Grading work without a clear rubric is a joke. It’s unfair and meaningless. Without standards, nitpicking after the fact is nothing but a power trip.

Evaluations should help people improve, not feed your ego.
