Truth is complicated not just in what it reveals but also in how it lands. The exact same words that feel liberating to someone can threaten another’s sense of safety.

Sometimes, reactions confirm you’ve touched something real. People don’t often fight against what doesn’t matter, nor try to silence what doesn’t resonate.

So, when your words create waves, don’t mistake the resistance for refutation. Truth is uncomfortable, but it’s doing exactly what it’s supposed to do.
