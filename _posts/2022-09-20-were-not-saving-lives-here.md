Back in the days when I worked in consulting, most folks on my team (myself included) were tired, burned out, and fed up with working nights and weekends. 

Like me, most of us eventually left consulting, but I still remember that amid chaos, anxiety, and the pressure to deliver at all costs, there was one phrase that kept us a bit grounded.

**We write apps. We’re not saving lives here.**
