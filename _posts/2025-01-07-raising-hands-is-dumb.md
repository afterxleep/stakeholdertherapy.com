The rule of raising hands before talking is a reflection of dysfunction, not order. It tells you there are too many people in the room, most of them just waiting for their turn to speak instead of listening. 

By the time someone gets to talk, the moment for meaningful input is gone and while everyone sits rehearsing what they’ll say next, conversations twist into rushed comments and shallow points.

You’d think this rule creates fairness by giving more people a chance to speak, but it’s killing the conversation and diluting away engagement.

What you need is fewer participants, heated discussions, and clashing ideas where people genuinely listen, talk, take sides, and push back.

Not everything is a parliament session. Raising hands is dumb.
