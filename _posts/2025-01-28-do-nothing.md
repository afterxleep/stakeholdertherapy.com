We’ve been told time must be “invested” or “spent wisely.” Even free moments get hijacked by the guilt of productivity – learning something, working on side projects, or “catching up” on errands.

Find time to do nothing. Not the fake nothing where you scroll through your phone while half-watching Netflix. Real nothing. Staring at something, watching people go by. Letting your mind wander. Sitting in silence.

This is not a waste; it’s freeing. Your time doesn’t always need a purpose. Stop trying to fill it. You don’t need an explanation.
