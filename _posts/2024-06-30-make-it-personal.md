I take everything personally and don’t trust anyone who says they don’t. It’s either a lie or a sign that they don’t care enough. Emotional detachment is often seen as a strength, but it’s often an excuse for mediocrity. 

Taking things personally goes beyond emotional involvement. It’s a testament to commitment and authenticity. It shows you’re human and invested enough to understand the impact of your actions.

If you really care about making a difference, make it personal.
