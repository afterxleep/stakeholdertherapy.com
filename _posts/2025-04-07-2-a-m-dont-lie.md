Nodding at plans that aren’t yours. Following up on decisions you’ll never make. That’s easy. That’s alignment.

Purpose, on the other hand, shows up uninvited. It leaks into side projects, late-night writing, and fuels the frustration after another well-paid day that left you empty.

You can fake a lot of things. Everything but the reason you’re still awake at 2 a.m., building something that finally makes sense. To you, if no one else.

You can fake alignment. Not purpose.
