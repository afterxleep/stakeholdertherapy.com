It’s funny how often the loudest voice preaching about standards is the same person who created the mess in the first place.

Yesterday’s owners of rushed-out projects and half-assed solutions become today’s self-appointed guardians of process, picking apart everyone else’s work while conveniently forgetting their shortcuts.

What’s most ironic isn’t their conversion — it’s their complete lack of self-awareness and zero acknowledgment of the past, while everyone who’s been around sees through it. 

Everyone but themselves.
