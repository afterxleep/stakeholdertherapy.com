I’ve found a reference to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuYlGRnC7J8) in [Shawn Blanc’s blog](https://shawnblanc.net/2022/09/plan-vs-strategy-and-why-a-plan-is-not-a-strategy/) the other day and loved how it explains the difference between the two concepts.

It is fascinating to watch as a reminder, especially because planning is comfortable, and we tend to do too much of it. 

Planning makes us feel we’re in control and think we are moving forward, but while we spend days sitting down in a room planning the next move, at least one competitor is figuring out how to win.

Strategy is also more than a list of goals. It has to be backed by a theory that explains and consolidates “WHY” and “HOW” in a coherent way.
