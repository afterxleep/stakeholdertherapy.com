I’ve never met anyone who burned out from working too much on something they love.

Burnout isn’t about the hours. It’s about the soul-crushing feeling of being undervalued and overwhelmed by things that don’t matter – the bureaucracy, the finger-pointing, the lack of autonomy, and endless processes.

Passion does not fade from fatigue; it dies from insignificance. When you’re doing what you love, time and tiredness become irrelevant.
