title: "The Cult Of Zero"

I bought into it. Inbox Zero. Archive or delete. The two minute principle. The entire fucking religion.

Processing everything felt like control. It wasn't. It was maintenance disguised as work.

Then Slack needed the same treatment. Then Teams. Then Notion. Then Linear. Every platform demanding its own zero.

We didn't solve communication. We turned it into a job.

Communication flows. Some of it matters. Most doesn't. You already know which is which without a system telling you.

Let it pile up. The people who matter will reach you.

Zero was always a trap.
