They built something, charged for it, made money, cashed out.

Then they rebranded.

New bio, new values. Suddenly they're open source advocates posting about community.

They judge others for keeping their work closed. Call it "a shame" when someone won't give them what they never gave anyone else.

This is the grift. Get yours first, then lecture everyone about how they should do it differently. Free.

Their past was business, other people's work is greed.

The industry is full of these idiots. Retired on closed source, preaching open source. Comfortable enough to have opinions about how others charge for their work.

Fuck them.
