Nowadays, every piece of work needs a marketing sparkle as, if slapping buzzwords on everyday work would make it more meaningful.

“Strategic Excellence Month,” “Transformative Innovation Week,” “Enhanced Stability Sprint,” etc., are bullshit titles for work that already has value.

Your team sees through it. They always have, they always will. This repackaging isn’t just unnecessary—it’s harmful. It creates distance between people and purpose.

Rebranding doesn’t elevate the work. It suggests you don’t trust your team to care about their craft without the sugar coating. It suggests that regular work isn’t worth doing unless it sounds like a TED talk.

Just call things what they are. Instead of rebranding the obvious, get it done.
