Learn to accept risks and live by them. Removing every possible risk results in bland, uninspired work that aims to offend no one.

De-risking everything makes you ship average shit. The fear of failure and making mistakes leads to a culture where safety and mediocrity become the norm. You’re left with something so sanitized that it fails to compete, yet you think it is great.

You should be embracing risks, not removing them.
