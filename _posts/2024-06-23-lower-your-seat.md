When you get into a new car, you adjust the seat. Most people raise it to see the hood and the nearest part of the road. It feels like control. But we all ignore that raising the seat reduces our field of view, and we see less of what’s on the road far ahead. 

Life’s the same. Elevating your status may give you a false sense of security and narrow your perspective. While it makes you feel powerful and in control, it forces you to look down, thus preventing you from thinking about what’s coming up next.

Next time, try lowering your seat.
