The meeting sucks, but we call it “productive.” Shitty ideas are framed as “interesting.” Dead projects have “challenges”, and that deadline is impossible, but you’ll “do your best.”

We confuse lying with kindness, call it “professionalism,” and let shitty decisions and inaction pile up while everything rots around us.

Respect means telling people the truth.
